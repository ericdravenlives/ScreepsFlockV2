Summary:
A tiered approach to spawning and managing a spawn point from inception to end game based on a rooms controller level and utilizing manual building commands.

Phase 1:
Choose a spawn point.
Spawn main loop will check the room controller that it is in.
If the current room controller is less than level 2, spawn a BootBot.
BootBot config: MOVE,CARRY,WORK (200 Cost)
BootBot -> harvest nearest energy source -> Upgrade Room Controller until level 2 -> BootBot Self-terminates until controller is under level 2

Phase 2:
Spawn Checks Controller level is above 2
Spawn Checks current creeps, if no creeps are active, spawn a basic worker.
BasicWorker config: MOVE,CARRY,WORK
BasicWorker -> harvest nearest energy source -> Deposit Energy at Spawn -> BasicWorker Self-terminates when Room.Structures.Storage > 1
If spawn sees at least 2 basic workers, spawn at least 2 Basic Builder.
Basic Builder config: MOVE,CARRY,WORK
BasicBuilder -> harvest nearest energy source -> Deposit Energy at Spawn -> BasicWorker Self-terminates when Room.Structures.Storage > 1
